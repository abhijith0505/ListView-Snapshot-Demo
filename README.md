A demo android application that uses the listview-snapshot android library.

Use this library to convert any listview into an image (snapshot) and store it anywhere in your phone.

# Usage

You will need to use the **jcenter()** repository in your project level **build.gradle** to use the library with a single line of gradle script.

    allprojects {
	    repositories {
	        jcenter()
	    }
    }
To use the library, add the following dependency to your app level build.gradle file:    	**compile 'com.abhijith:listview-snapshot:1.+'**
    
    dependencies {
		 compile 'com.abhijith:listview-snapshot:1.+'
		...
    }
    
    
Add the permission required in your **Android Manifest**
```
<manifest ...>
    <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
    ...
</manifest>
```

Use the library by making an object of the class **ListViewSnapshot**.

    ListViewSnapshot listViewSnapshot = new ListViewSnapshot(listView, getApplicationContext(), getBaseContext());

Parameters:
- The instance of ListView that has to be saved as a Snapshot.
- Application Context
- Base Context 



To save the listview as a snapshot, use the **convertWholeListViewItemsToSnapshot()** method.

    listViewSnapshot.convertWholeListViewItemsToSnapshot();

The Snapshot is saved to the default location:       
   
    Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()
                + "/Android/data/"
                + applicationContext.getPackageName()
                + "/Files";

Example:  /sdcard/Android/data/com.abhijith.listview_snapshot_demo/Files
              
 The default name given to the Snapshot is:
      
         "List_"+ timeStamp +".jpg"
         
	    Where the time-stamp is :  ddMMyyy + "_" + Hours + Minutes + Seconds
Example:   List_30072016_123310.jpg


* To provide custom location to store the Snapshot, use the **setPathtoSnapshot(newPath)** method.

        listViewSnapshot.setPathtoSnapshot(newPath);

*  To provide custom name for the Snapshot, use the **renameSnapshot(newName)** method.

        listViewSnapshot.setPathtoSnapshot(newPath);
